# Now that `babel-preset-env` has stabilized, it has been [moved into the main Babel mono-repo](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-env) and this repo has been archived.

The move makes it much easier to release and develop in sync with the rest of Babel!

This repo will be made read-only, as all of the issues/labels have been moved over as well. Please report any bugs and open pull requests over on the [main mono-repo](https://github.com/babel/babel).

> A Babel preset that compiles [ES2015+](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) down to ES5 by automatically determining the Babel plugins and polyfills you need based on your targeted browser or runtime environments.

```sh
npm install babel-preset-env --save-dev
```

Without any configuration options, babel-preset-env behaves exactly the same as babel-preset-latest (or babel-preset-es2015, babel-preset-es2016, and babel-preset-es2017 together).

> However, we don't recommend using `preset-env` this way because it doesn't take advantage of it's greater capabilities of targeting specific browsers.

```json
{
  "presets": ["env"]
}
```

You can also configure it to only include the polyfills and transforms needed for the browsers you support. Compiling only what's needed can make your bundles smaller and your life easier.

This example only includes the polyfills and code transforms needed for coverage of users > 0.25%, ignoring Internet Explorer 11 and Opera Mini
